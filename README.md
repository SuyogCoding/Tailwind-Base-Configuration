# Node.js Project Setup with Tailwind CSS and Vite

This guide will help you set up a Node.js project with Tailwind CSS and Vite. This project is created by Suyog Coding for educational purposes.

## Steps to Initialize and Set Up the Project

### 1. Initialize the Directory as a Node.js Project
```sh
npm init -y
```

### 2. Install Required Packages
```sh
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer vite
```

### 3. Initialize Tailwind CSS Configuration
```sh
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

### 4. Create and Edit a CSS File
Create a file named `input.css` and add the following content:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Include this `input.css` file in your HTML.

### 5. Update Tailwind CSS Configuration
In your `tailwind.config.js` file, replace `content[]` with:
```js
content: ["*"],
```

### 6. Update `package.json` Scripts
Add the following script to your `package.json` file:
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "vite"
}
```

### 7. Start the Development Server
Run the following command to start a development server:
```sh
npm run start
```

### Additional Configuration
To view all the configuration options, run:
```sh
npx tailwindcss init confsuyog --full
```

### Build Node Modules
Before running the above command, ensure you have all required node modules by running:
```sh
npm i
```
(Note: Node.js must be installed on your system.)

## Pushing the Site to Production

### Update `package.json` Scripts for Production
Add the following commands to the `scripts` section of your `package.json`:
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "vite",
  "build": "vite build"
}
```

### Build the Project for Production
Run the following command to build the project:
```sh
npm run build
```

This will build a folder called `dist` where you will get the production files.

Run the following command again if you make any changes:
```sh
npm run build
```

This completes the setup of your Node.js project with Tailwind CSS and Vite. Enjoy coding!
